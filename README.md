# A-brief-description
The repositories I am interested in is JustAuth. I am aware of it the trending repositories recommended by Github, which means it is popular now. As a newbee of Github, I am still confused about how its function will be done, but I am attracted by the aim of the project-- to give the user more convinient feeling.
Also, it shows directly me how codes can affect our life.
